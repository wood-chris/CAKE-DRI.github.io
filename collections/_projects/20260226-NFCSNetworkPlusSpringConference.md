The NFCS NetworkPlus 3rd National Conference will bring together all 26 project partners to review the initial Federation Roadmap findings 
from the 13 first phase projects and to hear what the 13 second phase projects plan to contribute as they begin their work.

In addition to interim reporting at the halfway stage to the NFCS Roadmap, the conference has invited guest speakers to present insight on 
their experiences in planning, developing and managing DRI federation both nationally and internationally across a several areas of research.

The event will be held in a distinctively different venue; MShed is Bristol’s museum which showcases its technological, mercantile and social histories over the last 600 years.

Building on the successfully broad and inclusive Autumn conference in Edinburgh we expect an even better forum to enable the sharing and 
sharpening of ideas of how to plan the building and operation of our national federated compute service to enhance the UK's digital research infrastructure.
