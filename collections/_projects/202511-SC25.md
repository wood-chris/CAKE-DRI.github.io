---

**The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis.** 

**St. Louis, MO, USA • NOV 16–21**

SC is the world's largest HPC conference, and an unparalleled mix of thousands of scientists, engineers, researchers, educators, programmers, and developers who intermingle to learn, share, and grow. As usual there will be a strong UK presence across the entire event.

## UK-based exhibition booths at SC

There are four booths that you should definately check out at SC this year, the first is EPCC (booth 2832) from the University of Edinburgh who host the UK national supercomputer, ARCHER2, and undertake a range of projects and research on HPC and AI. Secondly, the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC, booth 4417) who host several HPC systems and fund a wide range of work in this area as well as leading CoSeC which is enables and supports collaborative computational research communities that are funded across UKRI. The UK University's booth (6403) is new this year and represents multiple UK Universitys, providing them with a space to highlight their successes and activities, and indeed in CAKE we are involved in this booth. Lastly, the University of Bristol (booth 6317) will be showcasing their work on Isambard-AI. There will be a treasure hunt organised between the booths, with the opportunity to win one of four lego sets!
