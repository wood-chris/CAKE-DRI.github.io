**What is CIUK?**

Since its inception in 1990, this event formerly known as the Machine Evaluation Workshop, combines an exhibition of the latest High Performance Computing (HPC) hardware and software with a programme of presentations from users  who provide delegates with an overview of their use of HPC in real life situations.

The conference programme includes an exhibition of the latest hardware and software releases, a full two-day series of presentations and breakout sessions, the Student Cluster Challenge, plenty of networking opportunities such as the Women in HPC Breakfast, an evening event and much more.

## Breakout: From ExCALIBUR to DRI, linking the UK's compute programmes 

When: Friday 5th from 2pm to 4pm

Where: Breakout room (exchange room 9 - 11)

ExCALIBUR, which ran between 2019 and 2025, aimed to get the UK's HPC software ready for exascale computing. In many ways, the Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) programme follows on from ExCALIBUR but also takes things in a somewhat different direction with emphasis on different communities. This session aims to bring these two programmes together, to share the outcomes and successes of ExCALIBUR with DRI projects to ensure that the work done in the one programme can be leveraged, and is not reinvented, by the other. Aiming for an informal discussion, and enabling us to continue discussions beyond the network plus session before lunch, we aim to help form and solidify networks between what is going on in the UK.
