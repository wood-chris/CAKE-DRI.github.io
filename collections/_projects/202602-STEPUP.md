Join [STEP-UP](https://step-up.ac.uk/), the [University of Cambridge Data Service](https://www.data.cam.ac.uk/) and [Reproducible Research Cambridge](https://www.reproducibleresearchcambridge.co.uk/) on 10 February 2026 during [Love Data Week](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/sites/icpsr/about/news-events/international-love-data-week) for an event focused on bridging research software and research data communities.

As recognition grows of the increasingly vital role that “[digital Research Technical Professionals](https://step-up.ac.uk/drtp/)” (dRTPs) play in undertaking research, we will bring together representatives of two key communities within the dRTP space. Whether you consider yourself to be a Research Software Engineer, a Data Steward or Champion, a researcher or just someone interested in software or data, join us for keynotes, lighting talks and discussion to share our experiences, build connections and identify new opportunities for supporting, recognising and rewarding research software and research data practitioners.
