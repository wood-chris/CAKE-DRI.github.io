summary: Shaping the future of national federated digital research infrastructure together.
---

Federated Digital Research Infrastructures (DRIs) are transforming how research and innovation happen across institutions, disciplines and data systems. Yet building truly inclusive, connected and culturally aware infrastructures demands a deeper understanding of power dynamics as well as the diverse practices, values and experiences of those who use them or who currently cannot.

This workshop series offers a unique opportunity to actively shape the future of national federated compute services. We will explore how people engage with federated DRIs, examine why some communities remain excluded, and co-create practical pathways towards more accessible and inclusive research infrastructure.

Drawing on findings from our national survey and interviews with users and providers, we will work together to map the challenges and opportunities ahead. Through collaborative futures thinking, you will help develop future scenarios that reflect diverse user perspectives and establish recommendations for the future of federated research communities.

Your voice and experience are essential to creating research infrastructures that work for everyone. Join us to contribute to a shared vision of what's possible and help build the foundations for more equitable digital research in the UK.

Whether you're an experienced user of federated services or someone whose needs have not yet been met by current provision, this workshop will equip you with insights and connections to navigate and influence the evolving landscape of digital research infrastructure.

London: 17 February 2026 – UCL Knowledge Lab
Daresbury: 24 February 2026 – Hartree Centre
Edinburgh: 17 March 2026 – Edinburgh Futures Institute

All events run from 9:30am to 16:00pm GMT
