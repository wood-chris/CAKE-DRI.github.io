Participants in this first DisCouRSE in-person focus group are gathered to explore how leadership can influence a healthy team culture in a digital Research Technical Professional (dRTP) context, with the aim of exchanging ideas and practices.
The format will begin with a provocation by a researcher and leadership coach drawing on selected leadership studies followed by a dRTP leader response.
The day will include presentations on practices from the community with time to reflect on their applicability.

Please [register](https://forms.office.com/e/6XNPZVpB4g) your interest in attending.
If we are over-subscribed, places will be allocated to ensure that we have a diverse range of dRTP roles represented.
