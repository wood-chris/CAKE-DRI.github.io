As the demand for digital research technical professional (dRTP) skills grows, so does the need for high-quality training. There are many repositories of excellent training out there, e.g. the Carpentries, CodeRefinery, ELIXIR, HDR UK Futures, DRESA… So how do we make sure we’re (1) not duplicating effort and (2) developing training for all the skills needed?

This workshop is for organisations involved in developing, delivering, or investing in skills training for research software, data, and computing infrastructure professionals.

At this workshop we start by sharing findings from the STEP-UP project’s mapping of existing training onto dRTP competency frameworks. This will be a starting point for discussing:

- Which competencies can be practically taught
- How to prioritise addressing the gaps in training offerings
- How the community can best coordinate efforts to develop new training
- How to ensure the sustainability of training offerings
- The value of a dRTP-wide perspective that cuts across professional boundaries

Whether you’re part of a university training team, a community group, or an organisation investing in dRTP skills, this session is a chance to discuss common challenges facing the whole dRTP space.
