summary: Fortran index hackathon focusing on documenting common Fortran optimisation patterns.
---

The [Fortran index](https://github.com/fortran-index/fortran-index) hackathon
series aims to improve knowledge exchange within the Fortran programming
community by adding, correcting, and curating the information available in the
[fortran-lang](https://fortran-lang.org) community resource.

In this special edition hackathon -- run in collaboration with the Special
Interest Group for Reasonable Performance Computing
([SIG-RPC](https://sig-rpc.github.io/)) -- we will instead focus on documenting
common Fortran optimisation patterns on their website, with the goal of helping
researchers to write efficient Fortran code.

The event will be hosted online, running from Monday 26th January 2026 between
14:00 and 16:30 UTC. Register for the hackathon by filling out the following
