## Event Overview
The Software Sustainability Institute's annual Collaborations Workshop is an immersive, three-day unconference, which emphasises active collaborations, dynamic discussions, and hands-on problem-solving.

CW26 will centre around one powerful theme and clear purpose: Strengthening the Research Software Community. Through inspiring talks, interactive workshops, group discussions, and hands-on sessions, we’ll share knowledge, amplify diverse voices, and work together to ensure research software continues to thrive.

Find out more about the programme on the [CW26 webpage](https://www.software.ac.uk/workshop/collaborations-workshop-2026-cw26).

## Keynote Announcement
We are delighted to announce the first keynote speaker, Malvika Sharon, who will open the event, set the tone and inspire the discussion that follows. Malvika is the Senior Director of Data Science at the newly established Office of Data Science at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis.

## Take the Stage
Submissions for contributed [mini-workshops, demos and lightning talks](https://www.software.ac.uk/news/take-stage-cw26-submit-your-proposals-now) are still open for CW26. 

Mini-workshops and demo sessions offer unique opportunities for delegates and sponsors to give an in-depth look at a particular project, tool or approach related to the event themes. A lightning talk gives you two minutes and one slide to discuss a subject. Lightning talks are the perfect way to introduce yourself and your work at the workshop. 

The deadline for proposals is 23:59 GMT on Friday 16 January 2026.

## Emerging Voices Financial Support Scheme
Applications for the [Emerging Voices Financial Support Scheme](https://www.software.ac.uk/news/collaborations-workshop-2026-emerging-voices-financial-assistance) are still open. SSI is committed to fostering and supporting a diverse, equitable and inclusive research software community. This scheme is designed to help individuals who might otherwise be unable to attend the event.

The deadline for applications is 23:59 GMT on Friday 16 January 2026.
