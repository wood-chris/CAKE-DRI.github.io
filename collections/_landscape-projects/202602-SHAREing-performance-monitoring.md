summary: A workshop to understand options for monitoring performance of shared accelerated compute
---

The SHAREing Accelerated Compute Hub aims to share knowledge and skills
relating to running, programming, and utilising shared accelerated compute platforms.

A key gap that we have identified in the knowledge space for system administration is
understanding how to monitor
utilisation, efficiency, and performance of software on accelerated compute.

This workshop brings together
experts from hardware and software vendors and HPC centres
to share experiences and best practices
on how to connect hardware data to user workloads.

We welcome both in-person and remote participation in this event.
The Zoom link to participate remotely
will be sent to registered participants in advance of the event.
