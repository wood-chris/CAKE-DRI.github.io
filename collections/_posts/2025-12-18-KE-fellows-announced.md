The CAKE team is very excited to announce the first cohort of DRI Knowledge Exchange Fellows!

We welcome Joe Wallwork, Louise Chisholm and Lewis Sampson on board with CAKE, and are looking forward to seeing how they will champion knowledge exchange in their communities, as well
as the impact they will have on the CAKE community.
