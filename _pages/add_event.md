Please use the form below to add details of a new event that you'd like us to publish on the Events Listing page. If your event has an image to be displayed with the listing, this will need to be emailed separately to <cake-management@mlist.is.ed.ac.uk>, or you can submit a github pull request to add the image to the `assets/images/event-images/` folder in our website repo: <https://github.com/CAKE-DRI/CAKE-DRI.github.io>.
