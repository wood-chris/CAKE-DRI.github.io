# Our first cohort of DRI Knowledge Exchange Fellows

The CAKE team is very excited to introduce the first cohort of KE Fellows! These fellows will start their twelve-months term in January 2026, and will play a crucial part in shaping the CAKE community.

We are looking forward to see how their projects will develop over the coming year.

### Fortran index: Facilitating better knowledge exchange within the Fortran community

Many high quality learning resources and tools have been developed for the Fortran programming language over its seven decades of usage. However, their visibility is generally poor in the community. This fellowship builds on the work of the [Fortran index](https://github.com/fortran-index/fortran-index) hackathon series to facilitate better sharing of knowledge by adding to, correcting, and curating the information presented in the [fortran-lang](https://fortran-lang.org/) community resource.

### Basic introductions for the DRI community to the benefits and processes of Kubernetes

This fellowship aims to introduce members of the DRI community to the container orchestration platform Kubernetes (K8s). This platform is widely used throughout industry but has not been utilised as much across academia. Although not a one size fits all solution for research infrastructure, I am hoping to break the ice into the K8s world for RSEs, enable them to feel comfortable experimenting with the platform, and bring relevant members of the community together to encourage shared resources and reduced duplication of effort.

### CONNECT DRI:  Community of Practice for leaders of UKRI DRI facilities and services

CONNECT DRI’s objective is to establish and develop a community of practice (CoP) for leaders responsible for grant funded DRI facilities and services who are navigating the rapidly evolving DRI landscape. It brings together leaders across different facility types (e.g. data and/or compute) and disciplines. The CoP is focused on developing good practice regarding: 1) Approaches to inform the design, development and operations of DRI facilities and services, and 2) Approaches to maximise use and impact. The CoP will be delivered via a mixture of in person and online activities which will enable members to share their experience, lessons learned, hear from invited speakers and to develop good practice. It will foster new relationships and develop the network of UKRI DRI  leaders.
