We have two ways that you can add details of a new event to our Events Listing page, to help connect others with your work::

 - <a href="https://github.com/CAKE-DRI/cake.github.io" target="_blank">Submit a pull request to the Github repository for our website</a>
 - Use the form below. Note that if your event has an image to be displayed with the listing, this will need to be emailed separately to <cake-management@mlist.is.ed.ac.uk>, or you can submit a Github pull request to add the image to the `assets/images/event-images/` folder in our website repo: <https://github.com/CAKE-DRI/CAKE-DRI.github.io>.
